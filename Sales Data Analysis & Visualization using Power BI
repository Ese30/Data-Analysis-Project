## **Process**

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)**
- Checked for missing values and ensured data integrity.
- Removed duplicates to avoid inaccuracies.
- Verified that calculated columns (e.g., **Total Revenue = Units Sold Ã— Unit Price**) were correct.
- Ensured consistent formatting across date, numerical, and categorical fields.
- Exported the cleaned dataset for Power BI visualization.

### **2. Data Visualization & Analysis (Power BI)**

- **Total Revenue Analysis:** Identified total revenue generated by the company.
- **Regional Sales Analysis:** Determined which region contributed the most sales.
- **Category Performance:** Analyzed which product categories generated the most revenue.
- **Units Sold Analysis:** Examined which region sold the most units.
- **Monthly Sales Trends:** Observed how sales fluctuated across different months.
- **Payment Method Analysis:** Investigated the most frequently used payment methods per region.

## **Key Insights**

1. **North America generated the highest revenue**, followed by Asia and Europe.
2. **Clothing and Electronics were the top-selling categories**, indicating strong consumer demand.
3. **Units Sold were highest in Asia**, but revenue was highest in North America, suggesting North America had a higher average price per unit.
4. **Sales peaked in certain months**, indicating potential seasonal demand fluctuations.
5. **Credit cards were the most preferred payment method**, especially in North America and Asia.

## **Recommendations for Business Improvement**

1. **Expand Product Offerings in High-Performing Categories**  
   - Since **Clothing and Electronics** are the best-sellers, consider introducing more product variations or premium options in these categories.

2. **Targeted Regional Marketing**  
   - Since North America generates the highest revenue, **invest in premium product marketing in this region**.  
   - For Asia, where more units are sold but revenue is lower, consider **introducing higher-value products or bundle deals**.

3. **Optimize Seasonal Promotions**  
   - Since sales fluctuate across months, **analyzing peak and off-peak seasons** can help create targeted promotions and discounts during slow months.

4. **Improve Payment Flexibility**  
   - While **Credit Cards** are dominant, adding **more digital wallet options or Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services** could attract more customers, especially in regions like Europe where PayPal usage is high.

5. **Optimize Logistics and Inventory**  
   - Since different regions show different demand patterns, adjusting **inventory levels based on regional sales trends** can prevent stockouts and overstocking.
